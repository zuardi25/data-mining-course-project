# data-mining-course-project
Repository for all project/assignment from data mining course which I took in college. This repository contains 3 projects which all were done in R. All projects were done in a group of 4. 
The 3 projects consist of 3 different data mining task, they were: 
  1. **Classification** task for **Project 1**/ Tugas 1
  2. **Clustering** task for **Project 2**/ Tugas 2
  3. **Association rule** task for **Project 3**/ Tugas 3

Each task in project were done with several different algorithm, which then evaluated and compared with one another.
